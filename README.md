# CSI4160-final-project

The "General Details" of the Final Project assignments gave no specifics on the submission, 
So I will add a single PDF file with all the screenshots of me doing the steps you clarified in the deliverable on moodle, as well as me explaining what I am doing for each screenshot. 
I've spoken with other classmates on how to properly submit it to you so you'd be happy with the result, but with the lack of explanation from you, as well as a lack of a grading rubric, I have no choice but to submit the assignment in this way. 

I've also attached the bash script for initiating the google VM, the coding I had to do to make the SQL table, and the code that was present in node-red. 

Thank you for your understanding.
